# Why

This repository is a collection of modern web development tools aimed at creating fast, robust, and future-proof applications. These applications are designed to handle complex business domains, utilizing a domain-driven approach and setup to ensure scalability and maintainability. This repository is about:

- Using minimal and well-known libraries
- Writing clean code is a domain driven approach
- Well tested with unit tests and e2e tests

# Quickstart

To get started, you need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathi123/neurotic-web.git
cd neurotic-web
cp .env.example .env
pnpm i
pnpm db:start
pnpm db:migrate
```

And to start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

# Technologies

## Next.js

Next.js was installed using [manual install](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation#manual-installation) procedure. This contains a section on [TypeScript setup](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation#ide-plugin) in VS Code.

## TypeScript

The tsconfig file contains settings for compiling TypeScript. The following settings were modified:

- allowJs: set to false
- strict: set to true

In order for @/... imports to work, the following config was added:

```json
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["app/*"]
    }
```

## Commit message

Commit messages must use the [Conventional Commits](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) config.

## Linting

ESLint was set up to use 3 rule sets:

- Next.js rules
- TypeScript rules
- Prettier rules (such that they don't conflict)

The `max-len` rule is disabled for files in `app/app/components/ui` to allow longer lines in UI component files generated by ShadCN.

## Formatting

Prettier is used to automatically format code. The .prettierrc configures prettier and has a module to automatically format [tailwind css](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss). The settings.json file has a small section (files.associations) that associates css files with this plugin, such that syntax highlighting works correctly.

## Node Version

The Node.js version is indicated in .npmrc, and the pnpm version in package.json. These versions are also used on CI/CD. Be careful to run commands with pnpm, not your local npm version.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Vitest is used for running unit tests.

```bash

pnpm test
# Or with code coverage
pnpm test:coverage

```

## Database

### ORM

Prisma is used as an ORM. Modify the schema.prisma file, and add a migration as follows:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

Notes:

- Neon Adapter is used on production and Pg Adapter for local development
- To check: [connection pooling](https://vercel.com/guides/connection-pooling-with-functions) still relevant with Neon driver?

## Security

### Authentication

Better-auth is used for authentication. It supports email/password authentication and GitHub OAuth. Another open source package [better-auth-ui](https://better-auth-ui.com/) is used, to serve default pages for login, sign-up, password reset [etc](https://better-auth-ui.com/integrations/next-js#auth-pages). In case this package is not maintained anymore, the views from it can just be copied over.

#### Configuration

The auth server is configured in `app/auth.ts`:

- **Database**: Uses Prisma adapter with PostgreSQL
- **Email/Password**: Enabled by default
- **Social Providers**: GitHub OAuth (requires `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`)

#### API Routes

Auth API routes are handled at `/api/auth/[...all]` via the Next.js route handler in `app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`.

#### Client Usage

The auth client for React components is available via `app/app/auth.ts`:

```typescript
import { authClient } from '@/app/auth';

// Use authClient methods in your components
```

#### Database Schema

The authentication system uses the following Prisma models:

- `User`: User accounts
- `Session`: Active user sessions
- `Account`: OAuth provider accounts
- `Verification`: Email verification tokens

These models are automatically created when running the auth migration.

## Env Vars

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values. The app loads `.env` locally; `.env` is gitignored and not used in CI/CD.

| Variable              | Description                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| DATABASE_URL          | The database url.                                      |
| DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED | Direct database url, without connection pooling.       |
| GITHUB_CLIENT_ID      | GitHub OAuth client ID (required for GitHub auth).     |
| GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET  | GitHub OAuth client secret (required for GitHub auth). |

## Frontend

### Tailwind

Tailwind was installed using the [manual instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss) with postcss. You can use the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://open-vsx.org/extension/bradlc/vscode-tailwindcss) plugin for VSCode.

### ShadCN

ShadCn is used to build a compent library in this codebase. The [manual instructions](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/manual) were also followed to install this. The theming is configured to use a [dark mode](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/dark-mode/next).

## Documentation Guidelines

### URL Validation

All external URLs referenced in the README.md are automatically validated in CI/CD. The validation ensures that all links are accessible and will fail the CI/CD pipeline if any URLs are broken or inaccessible.

To validate URLs locally:

```bash
pnpm run docs
```

## Known Issues

### Turbopack

TurboPack and @prisma/pg-adapter don't work well together, for pnpm. The following error is thrown when instantiating the adapter.

```bash
Package pg can't be external
The request pg matches serverExternalPackages (or the default list).
The request could not be resolved by Node.js from the project directory.
Packages that should be external need to be installed in the project directory, so they can be resolved from the output files.
Try to install it into the project directory by running npm install pg from the project directory.
```

A temporary fix was to modify the .npmrc file as mentioned [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/76247).

```.npmrc
public-hoist-pattern[]=*pg*
```
