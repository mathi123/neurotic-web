# Documentation

Functional documentation lives in `docs/`. Keep it current when modifying features.

## Structure

```
docs/
└── {feature}.md
```

## Guidelines

- Write for developers who need to understand or extend the feature
- Include: purpose, functional usage and examples
- Keep concise — link to external docs for library details
- Update docs when changing related code

## When to Document

Document a feature when it:
- Has configuration or environment variables
- Integrates external services or libraries
- Has non-obvious behavior or conventions
