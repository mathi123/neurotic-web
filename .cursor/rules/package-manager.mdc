# Package Manager

Use pnpm (defined in `package.json`). Use pnpx instead of npx.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run a package binary
pnpx <command>
```

## Documenting New Packages

When installing new packages, **always** add an entry to the "Package Log" table in `README.md`. This helps maintain a clear record of why each dependency was added.

Format:
```markdown
| Reason for package      | package-name                                                                                           |
```

Example:
```markdown
| Data Table              | @tanstack/react-table                                                                                  |
```

Note: ShadCN components are added via `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`. Check `package.json` after installation to see if new packages were added and document them accordingly.
